This is a repository for text processing and visualization codes to provide search and interactive visualization interfaces for 450,000 webpages about Hurricane Harvey, which were extracted from tweets collected during the disaster.  Virginia Tech's Digital Library Research Laboratory helped crawling the webpages using the Heritrix Crawler.
